of lack of capacity by reason of anything in the company’s constitution.

to bind the company, or authorise others to do so, is deemed to be free of any limitation 
under the company’s constitution.

(a) a person “deals with” a company if he is a party to any transaction or other act 
to which the company is a party, 

(b) a person dealing with a company–

to bind the company or authorise others to do so,

that an act is beyond the powers of the directors under the company’s 
constitution. 

(3) The references above to limitations on the directors’ powers under the company’s 
constitution include limitations deriving– 

(a) from a resolution of the company or of any class of shareholders, or

shareholders. 

60

transaction, is liable– 

(a) to account to the company for any gain he has made directly or indirectly by the 
transaction, and 

(b) to indemnify the company for any loss or damage resulting from the transaction.

(a) restitution of any money or other asset which was the subject matter of the 
transaction is no longer possible, or 

(b) the company is indemnified for any loss or damage resulting from the 
transaction, or 

(c) rights acquired bona fide for value and without actual notice of the directors 
exceeding their powers by a person who is not party to the transaction would be 
affected by the avoidance, or 

(d) the transaction is affirmed by the company. 

(5) A person other than a director of the company is not liable under subsection (3) if he 
shows that at the time the transaction was entered into he did not know that the directors 
were exceeding their powers. 

61 
 



   

(6) Nothing in the preceding provisions of this section affects the rights of any party to the 
transaction not within subsection (2)(b)(i) or (ii). The Court may, on the application of 
the company or any such party, make an order affirming, severing or setting aside the 
transaction on such terms as appear to the Court to be just. 

(7) In this section– 

(a) “transaction” includes any act, and

powers as a director, in relation to any matter in which he has, or can have, a direct or 

121 
 



   

indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the 
company. 

(2) This applies in particular to the exploitation of any property, information or opportunity 
(and it is immaterial whether the company could take advantage of the property, 
information or opportunity). 

(3) This duty does not apply to a conflict of interest arising in relation to a transaction or 
arrangement with the company. 

(4) This duty is not infringed– 

(a) if the situation cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict 
of interest, or 

(b) if the matter has been authorised by the directors who do not have a direct or 
indirect interest that conflicts with the interests of the company in such matter 
(“non-conflicted directors”), or 

(c) if the matter is authorised by the members. 

(5) Authorisation may be given by the non-conflicted directors– 

(a) where the company is a private company and nothing in the company’s 
constitution invalidates such authorisation, by the matter being proposed to and 
authorised by the non-conflicted directors, or 

(b) where the company is a public company and its constitution includes provision 
enabling the non-conflicted directors to authorise the matter, by the matter being 
proposed to and authorised by them in accordance with the constitution. 

(6) The authorisation is effective only if– 

(a) any requirement as to the quorum at the meeting at which the matter is 
considered is met without counting the director in question or any other director 
with a direct or indirect interest that conflicts with the interests of the company 
in such matter, and 

(b) the matter was agreed to without their voting or would have been agreed to if 
their votes had not been counted. 

(7) Any reference in this section to a conflict of interest includes a conflict of interest and 
duty and a conflict of duties. 

166. Duty not to accept benefits from third parties 

(1) A director of a company must not accept a benefit from a third party conferred by reason 
of– 

(a) his being a director, or 

(b) his doing (or not doing) anything as director. 

(2) A “third party” means a person other than the company, an associated body corporate 
or a person acting on behalf of the company or an associated body corporate. 

(3) Benefits received by a director from a person by whom his services (as a director or 
otherwise) are provided to the company are not regarded as conferred by a third party. 

122 
 



   

(4) This duty is not infringed if the acceptance of the benefit cannot reasonably be regarded 
as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest. 

(5) Any reference in this section to a conflict of interest includes a conflict of interest and 
duty and a conflict of duties. 

167. Duty to declare interest in proposed transaction or arrangement 

(1) If a director of a company is in any way, directly or indirectly, interested in a proposed 
transaction or arrangement with the company, he must declare the nature and extent of 
that interest to the other directors. 

(2) The declaration may (but need not) be made– 

(a) at a meeting of the directors, or 

(b) by notice to the directors in accordance with– 

(i) section 173 (declaration made by notice in writing), or 

(ii) section 174 (general notice treated as sufficient declaration). 

(3) If a declaration of interest under this section proves to be, or becomes, inaccurate or 
incomplete, a further declaration must be made. 

(4) Any declaration required by this section must be made before the company enters into 
the transaction or arrangement. 

(5) This section does not require a declaration of an interest of which the director is not 
aware or where the director is not aware of the transaction or arrangement in question. 

For this purpose a director is treated as being aware of matters of which he ought 
reasonably to be aware. 

(6) A director need not declare an interest– 

(a) if it cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest, 

(b) if, or to the extent that, the other directors are already aware of it (and for this 
purpose the other directors are treated as aware of anything of which they ought 
reasonably to be aware), or 

(c) if, or to the extent that, it concerns terms of his service contract that have been 
or are to be considered– 

(i) by a meeting of the directors, or 

(ii) by a committee of the directors appointed for the purpose under the 
company’s constitution. 

168. Consequences of breach of general duties 

(1) The consequences of breach (or threatened breach) of sections 161 (duty to act within 
powers) to 167 (duty to declare interest in proposed transaction or arrangement) are the 
same as would apply if the corresponding common law rule or equitable principle 
applied pursuant to the laws applicable in the Abu Dhabi Global Market. 

123 
 



   

(2) The duties in those sections, (with the exception of section 164 (duty to exercise 
reasonable care, skill and diligence)), are, accordingly, enforceable in the same way as 
any other fiduciary duty owed to a company by its directors. 

169. Cases within more than one of the general duties 

Except as otherwise provided, more than one of the general duties may apply in any 
given case. 

170. Consent, approval or authorisation by members

(a) section 165 (duty to avoid conflicts of interest) is complied with by 
authorisation by the directors, or 

(b) section 167 (duty to declare interest in proposed transaction or arrangement) is 
complied with, 

the transaction or arrangement is not liable to be set aside by virtue of any common law 
rule or equitable principle requiring the consent or approval of the members of the 
company. 

This is without prejudice to any law or regulation applicable to the Abu Dhabi Global 
Market, or provision of the company’s constitution, requiring such consent or approval. 

(2) The application of the general duties is not affected by the fact that the case also falls 
within Chapter 4 (transactions requiring approval of members), except that where either 
of those Chapters applies and–  

(a) approval is given under the Chapter concerned, or  

(b) the matter is one as to which it is provided that approval is not needed, 

it is not necessary also to comply with section 165 (duty to avoid conflicts of interest) 
or section 166 (duty not to accept benefits from third parties). 

(3) Compliance with the general duties does not remove the need for approval under any 
applicable provision of Chapter 4 (transactions requiring approval of members).  

(4) The general duties– 

(a) have effect subject to any rule of law enabling the company to give authority, 
specifically or generally, for anything to be done (or omitted) by the directors, 
or any of them, that would otherwise be a breach of duty, and 

(b) where the company’s articles contain provisions for dealing with conflicts of 
interest, are not infringed by anything done (or omitted) by the directors, or any 
of them, in accordance with those provisions. 

(5) Otherwise, the general duties have effect (except as otherwise provided or the context 
otherwise requires) notwithstanding any rule of law applicable in the Abu Dhabi Global 
Market.

(i) the likely significance of the material to A in relation to the matter in 
respect of which he has been given a notice; and

A which would be caused by the material’s disclosure.

notice.

in considering a matter referred to it.

corporation, or 

205

votes recorded in favour of or against the resolution.

the demand is not subsequently withdrawn). 

338. Right to demand a poll

excluding the right to demand a poll at a general meeting on any question other than– 

(a) the election of the chairman of the meeting, or

(2) A provision of a company’s articles is void in so far as it would have the effect of

(b) by a member or members representing not less than 10% of the total voting 
rights of all the members having the right to vote on the resolution (excluding

to such requirements and restrictions as are– 

(a) necessary to ensure the identification of the person voting, and

Nothing in this subsection affects any power of a company to require reasonable 
evidence of the entitlement of any person who is not a member to vote.

authorise a person or persons to act as its representative or representatives at any 
meeting of the company.

(2) A person authorised by a corporation is entitled to exercise (on behalf of the 
corporation) the same powers as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual 
member of the company. 

(3) Where a corporation authorises more than one person, this subsection is subject to 
subsections (3) and (4). 

(4) On a vote on a resolution on a show of hands at a meeting of the company, each 
authorised person has the same voting rights as the corporation would be entitled to. 

(5) Where subsection (3) does not apply and more than one authorised person purports to 
exercise a power under subsection (2) in respect of the same shares– 

(a) if they purport to exercise the power in the same way as each other, the power 
is treated as exercised in that way, and

power is treated as not exercised.

holding the meeting or adjourned meeting,

time at which it was demanded.

or who may not be chairman. 

348. Right of proxy to demand a poll 

(1) The appointment of a proxy to vote on a matter at a meeting of a company authorises 
the proxy to demand, or join in demanding, a poll on that matter. 

(2) In applying the provisions of section 338(2) (requirements for effective demand), a 
demand by a proxy counts– 

(a) for the purposes of subsection (2)(a), as a demand by the member, 

(b) for the purposes of subsection (2)(b), as a demand by a member representing 
the voting rights that the proxy is authorised to exercise, 

(c) for the purposes of subsection (2)(c), as a demand by a member holding the 
shares to which those rights are attached. 

349. Notice required of termination of proxy’s authority 

(1) The following provisions apply as regards notice that the authority of a person to act as 
proxy is terminated (“notice of termination”).  

(2) The termination of the authority of a person to act as proxy does not affect– 

(a) whether he counts in deciding whether there is a quorum at a meeting, 

(b) the validity of anything he does as chairman of a meeting, or 

(c) the validity of a poll demanded by him at a meeting, 

unless the company receives notice of the termination before the commencement of the 
meeting. 

(3) The termination of the authority of a person to act as proxy does not affect the validity 
of a vote given by that person unless the company receives notice of the termination– 

(a) before the commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the 
vote is given, or 

(b) in the case of a poll taken more than 48 hours after it is demanded, before the 
time appointed for taking the poll. 

210

person other than the company, the references above to the company receiving notice 
have effect as if they were or (as the case may be) included a reference to that person.

extensive rights on members or proxies than are conferred by those sections.

one member whose effect would be to appoint a person as auditor in place of a person 
(the “outgoing auditor”) whose term of office has ended, or is to end– 

(a) in the case of a private company, at the end of the period for appointing auditors, 

(b) in the case of a public company, at the end of the next accounts meeting.

(a) in the case of a private company– 

(i) no period for appointing auditors has ended since the outgoing auditor 
ceased to hold office, or 

(ii) such a period has ended and an auditor or auditors should have been 
appointed but were not, 

(b) in the case of a public company– 

(i) there has been no accounts meeting of the company since the outgoing 
auditor ceased to hold office, or 

(ii) there has been an accounts meeting at which an auditor or auditors

notice of the meeting is or has been sent.

late or because of the company’s default, the outgoing auditor may (without prejudice 
to his right to be heard orally) require that the representations be read out at the meeting. 

(7) Copies of the representations need not be sent out and the representations need not be 
read at the meeting if, on the application either of the company or of any other person 
claiming to be aggrieved, the Court is satisfied that the auditor is using the provisions 
of this section to secure needless publicity for defamatory matter.

part by the outgoing auditor, notwithstanding that he is not a party to the application.

would otherwise attach to him in connection with any negligence, default, 
breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the company occurring in the 
course of the audit of accounts, or 

(b) by which a company directly or indirectly provides an indemnity (to any extent) 
for an auditor of the company, or of an associated company, against any liability 
attaching to him in connection with any negligence, default, breach of duty or 
breach of trust in relation to the company of which he is auditor occurring in the 
course of the audit of accounts. 

287

(a) section 494 (indemnity for costs of successfully defending proceedings), or

in defending proceedings (whether civil or criminal) in which judgment is given in his 
favour or he is acquitted. 

495. Liability limitation agreements 

(1) A “liability limitation agreement” is an agreement that purports to limit the amount of 
a liability owed to a company by its auditor in respect of any negligence, default, breach 
of duty or breach of trust, occurring in the course of the audit of accounts, of which the 
auditor may be guilty in relation to the company. 

(2) Section 493 (general voidness of provisions protecting auditors from liability) does not 
affect the validity of a liability limitation agreement that–

rules made by the Board under that section, and 

(b) is authorised by the members of the company (see section 497 (authorisation of

limitation agreement).

provisions of a specified description, and

or provisions of a specified description. 

“Specified” here means specified in the rules. 

288 
 



    

(3) Without prejudice to the generality of the power conferred by subsection (2), that power 
may be exercised with a view to preventing adverse effects on competition. 

(4) Subject to the preceding provisions of this section, it is immaterial how a liability 
limitation agreement is framed. 

In particular, the limit on the amount of the auditor’s liability need not be a sum of 
money, or a formula, specified in the agreement. 

497. Authorisation of agreement by members of the company 

(1) A liability limitation agreement is authorised by the members of the company if it has 
been authorised under this section and that authorisation has not been withdrawn.

authorised– 

(a) by the company passing a resolution, before it enters into the agreement, 
waiving the need for approval,

approving the agreement’s principal terms, or 

(c) by the company passing a resolution, after it enters into the agreement, 
approving the agreement.

authorised–

agreement, approving the agreement’s principal terms, or

agreement, approving the agreement.

(b) the financial year to which the agreement relates, or 

(c) the limit to which the auditor’s liability is subject. 

(5) Authorisation under this section may be withdrawn by the company passing an ordinary 
resolution to that effect– 

(a) at any time before the company enters into the agreement, or 

(b) if the company has already entered into the agreement, before the beginning of 
the financial year to which the agreement relates. 

Subsection (5)(b) has effect notwithstanding anything in the agreement. 

289 
 



    

498. Effect of liability limitation agreement 

(1) A liability limitation agreement is not effective to limit the auditor’s liability to less 
than such amount as is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case having 
regard (in particular) to– 

(a) the auditor’s responsibilities under this Part, 

(b) the nature and purpose of the auditor’s contractual obligations to the company, 
and 

(c) the professional standards expected of him. 

(2) A liability limitation agreement that purports to limit the auditor’s liability to less than 
the amount mentioned in subsection (1) shall have effect as if it limited his liability to 
that amount. 

(3) In determining what is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case no 
account is to be taken of– 

(a) matters arising after the loss or damage in question has been incurred, or 

(b) matters (whenever arising) affecting the possibility of recovering compensation 
from other persons liable in respect of the same loss or damage. 

499. Disclosure of agreement by company 

(1) A company which has entered into a liability limitation agreement must make such 
disclosure in connection with the agreement as may be required under rules made by 
the Board.

made– 

(a) in a note to the company’s annual accounts (in the case of its individual

302

Dhabi Global Market offer or allot equity securities to a holder of ordinary shares of

(b) from paying up, with sums available for the purpose, any amounts for the time 
being unpaid on any of its shares.

rules for public companies). 

540. Meaning of payment in cash

(4) The Board may make rules providing that particular means of payment specified in the

counts as consideration other than cash. 

This does not apply for the purposes of Chapter 3 (allotment of equity securities:  
existing shareholders’ right of pre-emption).

up in cash, “cash” includes currency other than US dollars, or the currency in which the 
shares are to be issued. 

Additional rules for public companies 

541. Public companies:  shares taken by initial shareholders 

Shares taken by an initial shareholder of a public company in pursuance of an 
undertaking of his in the memorandum must be paid up in cash. 

542. Public companies:  must not accept undertaking to do work or perform services 

(1) A public company must not accept at any time, in payment up of its shares, an 
undertaking given by any person that he or another should do work or perform services 
for the company or any other person. 

(2) If a public company accepts such an undertaking in payment up of its shares, the holder 
of the shares when they are treated as paid up (in whole or in part) by the undertaking 
is liable- 

(a) to pay the company in respect of those shares an amount equal to their aggregate 
issue price, or, if the case so requires, such proportion of that amount as is 
treated as paid up by the undertaking, and 

(b) to pay interest at the appropriate rate on the amount payable under 
subsection (2)(a). 

 

(3) The reference in subsection (2) to the holder of shares includes a person who has an 
unconditional right- 

(a) to be included in the company’s register of members in respect of those shares, 
or 

(b) to have an instrument of transfer of them executed in his favour.

(a) the share is to be treated as if one-quarter of its issue price had been received, 
and

have been received in respect of the share under subsection (1) (less the value 
of any consideration actually applied in payment up, to any extent, of the share), 
with interest at the appropriate rate. 

(4) Subsection (3) does not apply to the allotment of bonus shares, unless the allottee knew 
or ought to have known the shares were allotted in contravention of this section. 

544. Public companies:  payment by long-term undertaking

if the consideration for the allotment is or includes an undertaking which is to be, or 
may be, performed more than five years after the date of the allotment. 

(2) If a company allots shares in contravention of subsection (1), the allottee is liable to pay 
the company an amount equal to the aggregate issue price of the shares so allotted (or, 
if the case so requires, so much of that aggregate as is treated as paid up by the 
undertaking), with interest at the appropriate rate. 

(3) Where a contract for the allotment of shares does not contravene subsection (1), any 
variation of the contract that has the effect that the contract would have contravened the 
subsection, if the terms of the contract as varied had been its original terms, is void. 

This applies also to the variation by a public company of the terms of a contract entered 
into before the company was re-registered as a public company. 

(4) Where- 

(a) a public company allots shares for a consideration which consists of or includes 
(in accordance with subsection (1)) an undertaking that is to be performed 
within five years of the allotment, and 

(b) the undertaking is not performed within the period allowed by the contract for 
the allotment of the shares, 

the allottee is liable to pay the company, at the end of the period so allowed, an amount 
equal to the aggregate issue price of the shares (or, if the case so requires, so much of 
that aggregate as is treated as paid up by the undertaking), with interest at the 
appropriate rate.

contract relating to payment in respect of them.

respect of liability to a company arising under any provision of this Chapter or Chapter

liabilities).

(b) the valuer’s report has been made to the company during the six months 
immediately preceding the allotment of the shares, and

(2) For this purpose the application of an amount standing to the credit of- 

(a) any of a company’s reserve accounts, or

(a) the allottee has not received the valuer’s report required to be sent to him, or

section 553 that the allottee knew or ought to have known amounted to a 
contravention,

(4) This section applies to an arrangement only if under the arrangement it is open to all 
the holders of the shares in company B (or, where the arrangement applies only to shares 
of a particular class, to all the holders of shares of that class) to take part in the 
arrangement. 

(5) In determining whether that is the case, the following shall be disregarded- 

(a) shares held by or by a nominee of company A,

up- 

(i) by the consideration,

any cash by which the aggregate issue price for the shares is to be paid up, is 
not less than so much of the aggregate issue price for the shares as is treated as 
paid up by the consideration and any such cash. 

554. Copy of report to be delivered to Registrar 

(1) A company to which a report is made under section 550 as to the value of any 
consideration for which, or partly for which, it proposes to allot shares must deliver a

exemption, have more than one remedy against a particular person, it should be 
for the company to decide which remedy it should remain entitled to pursue.

CLASSES OF SHARE AND CLASS RIGHTS 

Introductory 

570. Classes of shares 

(1) For the purposes of these Regulations shares are of one class if the rights attached to 
them are in all respects uniform. 

(2) For this purpose the rights attached to shares are not regarded as different from those 
attached to other shares by reason only that they do not carry the same rights to 
dividends in the 12 months immediately following their allotment. 

Variation of class rights 

571. Variation of class rights:  companies having a share capital 

(1) This section is concerned with the variation of the rights attached to a class of shares in 
a company having a share capital. 

(2) Rights attached to a class of a company’s shares may only be varied- 

(a) in accordance with provision in the company’s articles for the variation of those 
rights, or 

(b) where the company’s articles contain no such provision, if the holders of shares 
of that class consent to the variation in accordance with this section. 

(3) This is without prejudice to any other restrictions on the variation of the rights. 

321 
 



    

(4) The consent required for the purposes of this section on the part of the holders of a class 
of a company’s shares is- 

(a) consent in writing from the holders of at least three-quarters of the issued shares 
of that class (excluding any shares held as treasury shares), or 

(b) a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of that 
class sanctioning the variation. 

(5) Any amendment of a provision contained in a company’s articles for the variation of 
the rights attached to a class of shares, or the insertion of any such provision into the 
articles, is itself to be treated as a variation of those rights. 

(6) In this section, and (except where the context otherwise requires) in any provision in a 
company’s articles for the variation of the rights attached to a class of shares, references 
to the variation of those rights include references to their abrogation. 

572. Variation of class rights:  companies without a share capital 

(1) This section is concerned with the variation of the rights of a class of members of a 
company where the company does not have a share capital. 

(2) Rights of a class of members may only be varied-

rights, or 

(b) where the company’s articles contain no such provision, if the members of that 
class consent to the variation in accordance with this section. 

(3) This is without prejudice to any other restrictions on the variation of the rights. 

(4) The consent required for the purposes of this section on the part of the members of a 
class is- 

(a) consent in writing from at least three-quarters of the members of the class, or 

(b) a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the members of that 
class sanctioning the variation. 

(5) Any amendment of a provision contained in a company’s articles for the variation of 
the rights of a class of members, or the insertion of any such provision into the articles, 
is itself to be treated as a variation of those rights. 

(6) In this section, and (except where the context otherwise requires) in any provision in a 
company’s articles for the variation of the rights of a class of members, references to 
the variation of those rights include references to their abrogation. 

573. Variation of class rights:  saving for Court’s powers under other provisions 

Nothing in section 571 or 572 (variation of class rights) affects the power of the Court 
under- 

(a) section 82 (application to cancel resolution for public company to be re-
registered as private), 

(b) Part 25 (arrangements and reconstructions), or 

(c) Part 28 (protection of members against unfair prejudice). 

322 
 



    

574. Right to object to variation:  companies having a share capital 

(1) This section applies where the rights attached to any class of shares in a company are 
varied under section 571 (variation of class rights:  companies having a share capital). 

(2) The holders of not less in the aggregate than 15% of the issued shares of the class in 
question (being persons who did not consent to or vote in favour of the resolution for 
the variation) may apply to the Court to have the variation cancelled. 

For this purpose any of the company’s share capital held as treasury shares is 
disregarded. 

(3) If such an application is made, the variation has no effect unless and until it is confirmed 
by the Court. 

(4) Application to the Court- 

(a) must be made within 21 days after the date on which the consent was given or 
the resolution was passed (as the case may be), and 

(b) may be made on behalf of the shareholders entitled to make the application by 
such one or more of their number as they may appoint in writing for the purpose. 

(5) The Court, after hearing the applicant and any other persons who apply to the Court to 
be heard and appear to the Court to be interested in the application, may, if satisfied 
having regard to all the circumstances of the case that the variation would unfairly 
prejudice the shareholders of the class represented by the applicant, disallow the 
variation, and shall if not so satisfied confirm it. 

The decision of the Court on any such application is final. 

(6) References in this section to the variation of the rights of holders of a class of shares 
include references to their abrogation.

apply to the Court to have the variation cancelled. 

(3) If such an application is made, the variation has no effect unless and until it is confirmed 
by the Court. 

(4) Application to the Court must be made within 21 days after the date on which the 
consent was given or the resolution was passed (as the case may be) and may be made 
on behalf of the members entitled to make the application by such one or more of their 
number as they may appoint in writing for the purpose. 

(5) The Court, after hearing the applicant and any other persons who apply to the Court to 
be heard and appear to the Court to be interested in the application, may, if satisfied 
having regard to all the circumstances of the case that the variation would unfairly 
prejudice the members of the class represented by the applicant, disallow the variation, 
and shall if not so satisfied confirm it. 

The decision of the Court on any such application is final.

the winding up, or 

(ii) in any other case, that the company will be able to pay (or otherwise

the Court for an order confirming the reduction.

(a) diminution of liability in respect of unpaid share capital, or 

(b) the payment to a shareholder of any paid-up share capital, 

section 587 (creditors entitled to object to reduction) applies unless the Court directs 
otherwise. 

(3) The Court may, if having regard to any special circumstances of the case it thinks proper 
to do so, direct that section 587 is not to apply as regards any class or classes of 
creditors. 

(4) The Court may direct that section 587 is to apply in any other case. 

587. Creditors entitled to object to reduction 

(1) Where this section applies (see section 586(2) and (4)), every creditor of the company 
who-  

(a) at the date fixed by the Court is entitled to any debt or claim that, if that date 
were the commencement of the winding up of the company would be admissible 
in proof against the company, and 

(b) can show that there is a real likelihood that the reduction would result in the 
company being unable to discharge his debt or claim when it fell due, 

is entitled to object to the reduction of capital. 

(2) The Court shall settle a list of creditors entitled to object. 

(3) For that purpose the Court- 

(a) shall ascertain, as far as possible without requiring an application from any 
creditor, the names of those creditors and the nature and amount of their debts 
or claims, and 

(b) may publish notices fixing a day or days within which creditors not entered on 
the list are to claim to be so entered or are to be excluded from the right of 
objecting to the reduction of capital. 

(4) If a creditor entered on the list whose debt or claim is not discharged or has not 
determined does not consent to the reduction, the Court may, if it thinks fit, dispense 
with the consent of that creditor on the company securing payment of his debt or claim. 

329 
 



    

(5) For this purpose the debt or claim must be secured by appropriating (as the Court may 
direct) the following amount- 

(a) if the company admits the full amount of the debt or claim or, though not 
admitting it, is willing to provide for it, the full amount of the debt or claim, 

(b) if the company does not admit, and is not willing to provide for, the full amount 
of the debt or claim, or if the amount is contingent or not ascertained, an amount 
fixed by the Court after the like enquiry and adjudication as if the company were 
being wound up by the Court. 

588. Offences in connection with list of creditors 

(1) If an officer of the company- 

(a) intentionally or recklessly- 

(i) conceals the name of a creditor entitled to object to the reduction of 
capital, or

(b) is knowingly concerned in any such concealment or misrepresentation, 

he commits a contravention of these Regulations. 

(2) A person commits a contravention of this section is liable to a level 2 fine. 

589. Court order confirming reduction 

(1) The Court may make an order confirming the reduction of capital on such terms and 
conditions as it thinks fit. 

(2) The Court must not confirm the reduction unless it is satisfied, with respect to every 
creditor of the company who is entitled to object to the reduction of capital that either- 

(a) his consent to the reduction has been obtained, or 

(b) his debt or claim has been discharged, or has determined or has been secured. 

(3) Where the Court confirms the reduction, it may order the company to publish (as the 
Court directs) the reasons for reduction of capital, or such other information in regard 
to it as the Court thinks expedient with a view to giving proper information to the public, 
and (if the Court thinks fit) the causes that led to the reduction. 

(4) The Court may, if for any special reason it thinks proper to do so, make an order 
directing that the company must, during such period (commencing on or at any time 
after the date of the order) as is specified in the order, add to its name as its last words 
the words “and reduced”. 

If such an order is made, those words are, until the end of the period specified in the 
order, deemed to be part of the company’s name. 

330

(ii) the total number of shares of that class, and 

(iii) the aggregate issue price of shares of that class, and 

(d) the amount paid up and the amount (if any) unpaid on each share.

effect- 

(a) in the case of a reduction of share capital that forms part of a compromise or 
arrangement sanctioned by the Court under Part 25 (arrangements and 
reconstructions)- 

(i) on delivery of the order and statement of capital to the Registrar, or 

(ii) if the Court so orders, on the registration of the order and statement of 
capital,

(4) Notice of the registration of the order and statement of capital must be published in 
such manner as the Court may direct.

(2) If it does so, the Court must specify in the order the changes to the company’s name 
and articles to be made in connection with the re-registration. 

(3) The company may then be re-registered as a private company if an application to that 
effect is delivered to the Registrar together with-

(b) notice of the company’s name, and a copy of the company’s articles, as altered 
by the Court’s order.

Effect of reduction of capital 

593. Liability of members following reduction of capital

(a) the issue price of the share as notified to the Registrar in the statement of capital 
delivered under section 585 or 590, and 

(b) the amount paid on the share or the reduced amount (if any) which is deemed to 
have been paid on it, as the case may be. 

(2) This is subject to section 594 (liability to creditor in case of omission from list). 

(3) Nothing in this section affects the rights of the contributories among themselves. 

594. Liability to creditor in case of omission from list of creditors 

(1) This section applies where, in the case of a reduction of capital confirmed by the Court- 

(a) a creditor entitled to object to the reduction of share capital is by reason of his 
ignorance- 

(i) of the proceedings for reduction of share capital, or 

(ii) of their nature and effect with respect to his debt or claim, 

not entered on the list of creditors, and 

(b) after the reduction of capital the company is unable to pay the amount of his 
debt or claim. 

(2) Every person who was a member of the company at the date on which the resolution 
for reducing capital took effect under section 590(3) is liable to contribute for the 
payment of the debt or claim an amount not exceeding that which he would have been 
liable to contribute if the company had commenced to be wound up on the day before 
that date. 

(3) If the company is wound up, the Court on the application of the creditor in question, 
and proof of ignorance as mentioned in subsection 594(1)(a), may if it thinks fit- 

(a) settle accordingly a list of persons liable to contribute under this section, and 

(b) make and enforce calls and orders on them as if they were ordinary 
contributories in a winding up. 

(4) The reference in subsection 594(1)(b) to a company being unable to pay the amount of 
a debt or claim has the same meaning as in section 200 (definition of inability to pay 
debts) of the Insolvency Regulations 2015.

723. Companies to which this Part applies

(2) The Board may make rules providing for this Part to extend to such companies as it 
may specify. 

724. Shares to which this Part applies 

(1) References in this Part to a company’s shares are to the company’s issued shares of a 
class carrying rights to vote in all circumstances at general meetings of the company 
(including any shares held as treasury shares). 

(2) The temporary suspension of voting rights in respect of any shares does not affect the 
application of this Part in relation to interests in those or any other shares. 

725. Notice by company requiring information about interests in its shares 

(1) A public company may give notice under this section to any person whom the company 
knows or has reasonable cause to believe- 

(a) to be interested in the company’s shares, or 

(b) to have been so interested at any time during the three years immediately 
preceding the date on which the notice is issued. 

(2) The notice may require the person- 

(a) to confirm that fact or (as the case may be) to state whether or not it is the case, 
and 

(b) if he holds, or has during that time held, any such interest, to give such further 
information as may be required in accordance with the following provisions of 
this section. 

(3) The notice may require the person to whom it is addressed to give particulars of his 
own present or past interest in the company’s shares (held by him at any time during 
the three year period mentioned in subsection (1)(b)). 

(4) The notice may require the person to whom it is addressed, where- 

(a) his interest is a present interest and another interest in the shares subsists, or 

(b) another interest in the shares subsisted during that three year period at a time 
when his interest subsisted, 

to give, so far as lies within his knowledge, such particulars with respect to that other 
interest as may be required by the notice.  

(5) The particulars referred to in subsections (3) and (4) include-

agreements), or 

(ii) an agreement or arrangement relating to the exercise of any rights 
conferred by the holding of the shares. 

(6) The notice may require the person to whom it is addressed, where his interest is a past 
interest, to give (so far as lies within his knowledge) particulars of the identity of the 
person who held that interest immediately upon his ceasing to hold it. 

(7) The information required by the notice must be given within such reasonable time as 
may be specified in the notice. 

726. Notice requiring information: order imposing restrictions on shares 

(1) Where- 

(a) a notice under section 725 (notice requiring information about interests in 
company’s shares) is served by a company on a person who is or was interested 
in shares in the company, and 

(b) that person fails to give the company the information required by the notice 
within the time specified in it, 

the company may apply to the Court for an order directing that the shares in question 
be subject to restrictions.  

For the effect of such an order see section 729 (consequences of order imposing 
restrictions). 

(2) If the Court is satisfied that such an order may unfairly affect the rights of third parties 
in respect of the shares, the Court may, for the purpose of protecting those rights and 
subject to such terms as it thinks fit, direct that such acts by such persons or descriptions 
of persons and for such purposes as may be set out in the order shall not constitute a 
breach of the restrictions. 

(3) On an application under this section the Court may make an interim order. 

Any such order may be made unconditionally or on such terms as the Court thinks fit.  

(4) Sections 730  to 734 make further provision about orders under this section. 

727. Notice requiring information: offences 

(1) A person who- 

(a) fails to comply with a notice under section 725 (notice requiring information 
about interests in company’s shares), or

(ii) recklessly makes a statement that is false in a material particular, 

contravenes these Regulations. 

394 
 



    

(2) A person does not contravene these Regulations under subsection (1)(a) if he proves 
that the requirement to give information was frivolous or vexatious. 

(3) A person who contravenes these Regulations under subsection (1) is liable to a fine of 
up to level 8. 

728. Notice requiring information: persons exempted from obligation to comply 

(1) A person is not obliged to comply with a notice under section 725 (notice requiring 
information about interests in company’s shares) if he is for the time being exempted 
by the Registrar from the operation of that section. 

(2) The Registrar must not grant any such exemption unless it is satisfied that, having 
regard to any undertaking given by the person in question with respect to any interest 
held or to be held by him in any shares, there are special reasons why that person should 
not be subject to the obligations imposed by that section. 

729. Consequences of order imposing restrictions 

(1) The effect of an order under section 726 that shares are subject to restrictions is as 
follows- 

(a) any transfer of the shares is void, 

(b) no voting rights are exercisable in respect of the shares, 

(c) no further shares may be issued in right of the shares or in pursuance of an offer 
made to their holder, 

(d) except in a liquidation, no payment may be made of sums due from the company 
on the shares, whether in respect of capital or otherwise. 

(2) Where shares are subject to the restriction in subsection (1)(a), an agreement to transfer 
the shares is void. 

This does not apply to an agreement to transfer the shares on the making of an order 
under section 732 made by virtue of subsection (3)(b) (removal of restrictions in case 
of Court-approved transfer).  

(3) Where shares are subject to the restriction in subsection (1)(c) or (d), an agreement to 
transfer any right to be issued with other shares in right of those shares, or to receive 
any payment on them (otherwise than in a liquidation), is void. 

This does not apply to an agreement to transfer any such right on the making of an order 
under section 732 made by virtue of subsection (3)(b) (removal of restrictions in case 
of Court-approved transfer).  

(4) The provisions of this section are subject- 

(a) to any directions under section 726(2) or section 731(3) (directions for 
protection of third parties), and 

(b) in the case of an interim order under section 726(3), to the terms of the order. 

395 
 



    

730. Penalty for attempted evasion of restrictions 

(1) This section applies where shares are subject to restrictions by virtue of an order under 
section 726. 

(2) A person contravenes these Regulations if he- 

(a) exercises or purports to exercise any right- 

(i) to dispose of shares that to his knowledge, are for the time being subject 
to restrictions, or 

(ii) to dispose of any right to be issued with any such shares, or 

(b) votes in respect of any such shares (whether as holder or proxy), or appoints a 
proxy to vote in respect of them, or 

(c) being the holder of any such shares, fails to notify of their being subject to those 
restrictions a person whom he does not know to be aware of that fact but does 
know to be entitled (apart from the restrictions) to vote in respect of those shares 
whether as holder or as proxy, or being the holder of any such shares, or being 
entitled to a right to be issued with other shares in right of them, or to receive 
any payment on them (otherwise than in a liquidation), enters into an agreement 
which is void under section 729(2) or (3). 

(3) If shares in a company are issued in contravention of these Regulations, a contravention 
of these Regulations is committed by- 

(a) the company, and 

(b) every officer of the company who is in default. 

(4) A person who contravenes these Regulations under this section is liable to a level 2 
fine. 

(5) The provisions of this section are subject-

section 731 or 732 (relaxation or removal of restrictions), and 

(b) in the case of an interim order under section 726(3), to the terms of the order. 

731. Relaxation of restrictions 

(1) An application may be made to the Court on the ground that an order directing that 
shares shall be subject to restrictions unfairly affects the rights of third parties in respect 
of the shares. 

(2) An application for an order under this section may be made by the company or by any 
person aggrieved. 

(3) If the Court is satisfied that the application is well-founded, it may, for the purpose of 
protecting the rights of third parties in respect of the shares, and subject to such terms 
as it thinks fit, direct that such acts by such persons or descriptions of persons and for 
such purposes as may be set out in the order do not constitute a breach of the restrictions. 

396 
 



    

732. Removal of restrictions 

(1) An application may be made to the Court for an order directing that the shares shall 
cease to be subject to restrictions. 

(2) An application for an order under this section may be made by the company or by any 
person aggrieved. 

(3) The Court must not make an order under this section unless- 

(a) it is satisfied that the relevant facts about the shares have been disclosed to the 
company and no unfair advantage has accrued to any person as a result of the 
earlier failure to make that disclosure, or 

(b) the shares are to be transferred for valuable consideration and the Court 
approves the transfer. 

(4) An order under this section made by virtue of subsection (3)(b) may continue, in whole 
or in part, the restrictions mentioned in section 729(1)(c) and (d) (restrictions on issue 
of further shares or making of payments) so far as they relate to a right acquired or offer 
made before the transfer. 

(5) Where any restrictions continue in force under subsection (4)- 

(a) an application may be made under this section for an order directing that the 
shares shall cease to be subject to those restrictions, and 

(b) subsection (3) does not apply in relation to the making of such an order. 

733. Order for sale of shares 

(1) The Court may order that the shares subject to restrictions be sold, subject to the Court’s 
approval as to the sale. 

(2) An application for an order under subsection (1) may only be made by the company. 

(3) Where the Court has made an order under this section, it may make such further order 
relating to the sale or transfer of the shares as it thinks fit. 

(4) An application for an order under subsection (3) may be made- 

(a) by the company, 

(b) by the person appointed by or in pursuance of the order to effect the sale, or 

(c) by any person interested in the shares. 

(5) On making an order under subsection (1) or (3) the Court may order that the applicant’s 
costs be paid out of the proceeds of sale. 

734. Application of proceeds of sale under Court order 

(1) Where shares are sold in pursuance of an order of the Court under section 733, the 
proceeds of the sale, less the costs of the sale, must be paid into Court for the benefit of 
the persons who are beneficially interested in the shares. 

(2) A person who is beneficially interested in the shares may apply to the Court for the 
whole or part of those proceeds to be paid to him. 

(3) On such an application the Court shall order the payment to the applicant of- 

397 
 



    

(a) the whole of the proceeds of sale together with any interest on them, or 

(b) if another person had a beneficial interest in the shares at the time of their sale, 
such proportion of the proceeds and interest as the value of the applicant’s 
interest in the shares bears to the total value of the shares. 

This is subject to the following qualification.  

(4) If the Court has ordered under section 733(5) that the costs of an applicant under that 
section are to be paid out of the proceeds of sale, the applicant is entitled to payment of 
his costs (or expenses) out of those proceeds before any person interested in the shares 
receives any part of those proceeds.

person or different persons), it may direct that the company is not to comply with any 
such request. 

The order must contain such provision as appears to the Court appropriate to identify 
the requests to which it applies.

(register of interests disclosed) as being a party to an agreement to which section 756 
applies (certain share acquisition agreements) ceases to be a party to the agreement, he 
may apply to the company for the inclusion of that information in the register.

(1) This section applies to determine for the purposes of this Part whether a person has an 
interest in shares. 

404 
 



    

(2) In this Part- 

(a) a reference to an interest in shares includes an interest of any kind whatsoever 
in the shares, and 

(b) any restraints or restrictions to which the exercise of any right attached to the 
interest is or may be subject shall be disregarded. 

(3) Where an interest in shares is comprised in property held on trust, every beneficiary of 
the trust is treated as having an interest in the shares. 

(4) A person is treated as having an interest in shares if- 

(a) he enters into a contract to acquire them, or 

(b) not being the registered holder, he is entitled- 

(i) to exercise any right conferred by the holding of the shares, or 

(ii) to control the exercise of any such right. 

(5) For the purposes of subsection (4)(b) a person is entitled to exercise or control the 
exercise of a right conferred by the holding of shares if he- 

(a) has a right (whether subject to conditions or not) the exercise of which would 
make him so entitled, or 

(b) is under an obligation (whether subject to conditions or not) the fulfilment of 
which would make him so entitled. 

(6) A person is treated as having an interest in shares if- 

(a) he has a right to call for delivery of the shares to himself or to his order, or 

(b) he has a right to acquire an interest in shares or is under an obligation to take an 
interest in shares. 

This applies whether the right or obligation is conditional or absolute. 

(7) Persons having a joint interest are treated as each having that interest. 

(8) It is immaterial that shares in which a person has an interest are unidentifiable. 

753. Interest in shares: right to subscribe for shares 

(1) Section 725 (notice by company requiring information about interests in its shares) 
applies in relation to a person who has, or previously had, or is or was entitled to 
acquire, a right to subscribe for shares in the company as it applies in relation to a person 
who is or was interested in shares in that company. 

(2) References in that section to an interest in shares shall be read accordingly. 

754. Interest in shares: family interests 

For the purposes of this Part a person is taken to be interested in shares in which- 

(a) his spouse, 

(b) any infant child or step-child of his, or 

405 
 



    

(c) either of his parents, 

is interested. 

755. Interest in shares: corporate interests 

(1) For the purposes of this Part a person is taken to be interested in shares if a body 
corporate is interested in them and- 

(a) the body or its directors are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions 
or instructions, or 

(b) he is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of one-third or more of the 
voting power at general meetings of the body. 

(2) For the purposes of this section a person is treated as entitled to exercise or control the 
exercise of voting power if- 

(a) another body corporate is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of that 
voting power, and 

(b) he is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of one-third or more of the 
voting power at general meetings of that body corporate. 

(3) For the purposes of this section a person is treated as entitled to exercise or control the 
exercise of voting power if- 

(a) he has a right (whether or not subject to conditions) the exercise of which would 
make him so entitled, or 

(b) he is under an obligation (whether or not subject to conditions) the fulfilment of 
which would make him so entitled. 

756. Interest in shares: agreement to acquire interests in a particular company 

(1) For the purposes of this Part an interest in shares may arise from an agreement between 
two or more persons that includes provision for the acquisition by any one or more of 
them of interests in shares of a particular public company (the “target company” for 
that agreement). 

(2) This section applies to such an agreement if- 

(a) the agreement includes provisions imposing obligations or restrictions on any 
one or more of the parties to it with respect to their use, retention or disposal of 
their interests in the shares of the target company acquired in pursuance of the 
agreement (whether or not together with any other interests of theirs in the 
company’s shares to which the agreement relates), and 

(b) an interest in the target company’s shares is in fact acquired by any of the parties 
in pursuance of the agreement. 

(3) The reference in subsection (2) to the use of interests in shares in the target company is 
to the exercise of any rights or of any control or influence arising from those interests 
(including the right to enter into an agreement for the exercise, or for control of the 
exercise, of any of those rights by another person). 

406 
 



    

(4) Once an interest in shares in the target company has been acquired in pursuance of the 
agreement, this section continues to apply to the agreement so long as the agreement 
continues to include provisions of any description mentioned in subsection (2). 

This applies irrespective of- 

(a) whether or not any further acquisitions of interests in the company’s shares take 
place in pursuance of the agreement, 

(b) any change in the persons who are for the time being parties to it, 

(c) any variation of the agreement. 

References in this subsection to the agreement include any agreement having effect 
(whether directly or indirectly) in substitution for the original agreement. 

(5) In this section- 

(a) “agreement” includes any agreement or arrangement, and 

(b) references to provisions of an agreement include- 

(i) undertakings, expectations or understandings operative under an 
arrangement, and 

(ii) any provision whether express or implied and whether absolute or not. 

References elsewhere in this Part to an agreement to which this section applies have a 
corresponding meaning. 

(6) This section does not apply- 

(a) to an agreement that is not legally binding unless it involves mutuality in the 
undertakings, expectations or understandings of the parties to it, or 

(b) to an agreement to underwrite or sub-underwrite an offer of shares in a 
company, provided the agreement is confined to that purpose and any matters 
incidental to it. 

757. Extent of obligation in case of share acquisition agreement 

(1) For the purposes of this Part each party to an agreement to which section 756 applies is 
treated as interested in all shares in the target company in which any other party to the 
agreement is interested apart from the agreement (whether or not the interest of the 
other party was acquired, or includes any interest that was acquired, in pursuance of the 
agreement). 

(2) For those purposes an interest of a party to such an agreement in shares in the target 
company is an interest apart from the agreement if he is interested in those shares 
otherwise than by virtue of the application of section 756 (and this section) in relation 
to the agreement. 

(3) Accordingly, any such interest of the person (apart from the agreement) includes for 
those purposes any interest treated as his under section 754 or 755 (family or corporate 
interests) or by the application of section 756 (and this section) in relation to any other 
agreement with respect to shares in the target company to which he is a party. 

407 
 



    

(4) A notification with respect to his interest in shares in the target company made to the 
company under this Part by a person who is for the time being a party to an agreement 
to which section 756 applies must- 

(a) state that the person making the notification is a party to such an agreement, 

(b) include the names and (so far as known to him) the addresses of the other parties 
to the agreement, identifying them as such, and 

(c) state whether or not any of the shares to which the notification relates are shares 
in which he is interested by virtue of section 756 (and this section) and, if so, 
the number of those shares. 

758. Information protected from wider disclosure 

(1) Information in respect of which a company is for the time being entitled to any 
exemption conferred by rules made under section 393(3) (information about related 
undertakings to be given in notes to accounts: exemption where disclosure harmful to 
company’s business)- 

(a) must not be included in a report under section 737 (report to members on 
outcome of investigation), and 

(b) must not be made available under section 743 (right to inspect and request copy 
of entries). 

(2) Where any such information is omitted from a report under section 737, that fact must 
be stated in the report. 

759. Reckoning of periods for fulfilling obligations 

Where the period allowed by any provision of this Part for fulfilling an obligation is 
expressed as a number of days, any day that is not a working day shall be disregarded 
in reckoning that period.

(a) an issue of shares as fully or partly paid bonus shares, 

408

(including the proceeds of any fresh issue of shares) or out of unrealised profits 
in accordance with Chapter 3, 4 or 5 of Part 17, 

(d) a distribution of assets to members of the company on its winding up. 

761. Distributions to be made only out of profits available for the purpose 

(1) A company may only make a distribution out of profits available for the purpose. 

(2) A company's profits available for distribution are its accumulated, realised profits, so 
far as not previously utilised by distribution or capitalisation, less its accumulated, 
realised losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganisation of 
capital duly made. 

762. Net asset restriction on distributions by public companies 

(1) A public company may only make a distribution- 

(a) if the amount of its net assets is not less than the aggregate of its called-up share 
capital and undistributable reserves, and 

(b) if, and to the extent that, the distribution does not reduce the amount of those 
assets to less than that aggregate. 

(2) For this purpose a company's “net assets” means the aggregate of the company's assets 
less the aggregate of its liabilities. 

(3) “Liabilities” here includes provisions of any kind. 

(4) A company's undistributable reserves are- 

(a) its capital redemption reserve,

(c) any other reserve that the company is prohibited from distributing- 

(i) by any regulation or law applicable in the Abu Dhabi Global Market 
(other than one contained in this Part), or 

(ii) by its articles. 

The reference in subsection (b) to capitalisation does not include a 
transfer of profits of the company to its capital redemption reserve. 

409 
 



    

CHAPTER 2  

JUSTIFICATION OF DISTRIBUTION BY REFERENCE TO ACCOUNTS 

763. Justification of distribution by reference to relevant accounts 

(1) Whether a distribution may be made by a company without contravening this Part is 
determined by reference to the following items as stated in the relevant accounts- 

(a) profits, losses, assets and liabilities, 

(b) provisions of any kind, 

(c) share capital and reserves (including undistributable reserves). 

(2) The relevant accounts are the company's last annual accounts, except that- 

(a) where the distribution would be found to contravene this Part by reference to 
the company's last annual accounts, it may be justified by reference to interim 
accounts, and 

(b) where the distribution is proposed to be declared during the company's first 
accounting reference period, or before any accounts have been circulated in 
respect of that period, it may be justified by reference to initial accounts. 

(3) The requirements of- 

section 764 (as regards the company's last annual accounts), 

section 765 (as regards interim accounts), and 

section 766 (as regards initial accounts), 

must be complied with, as and where applicable. 

(4) If any applicable requirement of those sections is not complied with, the accounts may 
not be relied on for the purposes of this Part and the distribution is accordingly treated 
as contravening this Part. 

764. Requirements where last annual accounts used 

(1) The company's last annual accounts means the company's individual accounts that were 
last circulated to members in accordance with section 405 (duty to circulate copies of 
annual accounts and reports). 

(2) The accounts must have been properly prepared in accordance with these Regulations, 
or have been so prepared subject only to matters that are not material for determining 
(by reference to the items mentioned in section 763(1)) whether the distribution would 
contravene this Part. 

(3) Unless the company is exempt from audit and the directors take advantage of that 
exemption, the auditor must have made his report on the accounts. 

(4) If that report was qualified- 

(a) the auditor must have stated in writing (either at the time of his report or 
subsequently) whether in his opinion the matters in respect of which his report 

410 
 



    

is qualified are material for determining whether a distribution would 
contravene this Part, and 

(b) a copy of that statement must- 

(i) in the case of a private company, have been circulated to members in 
accordance with section 405 (duty to circulate copies of annual accounts 
and reports), or 

(ii) in the case of a public company, have been laid before the company in 
general meeting. 

(5) An auditor's statement is sufficient for the purposes of a distribution if it relates to 
distributions of a description that includes the distribution in question, even if at the 
time of the statement it had not been proposed. 

765. Requirements where interim accounts used 

(1) Interim accounts must be accounts that enable a reasonable judgment to be made as to 
the amounts of the items mentioned in section 763(1). 

(2) Where interim accounts are prepared for a proposed distribution by a public company, 
the following requirements apply. 

(3) The accounts must have been properly prepared, or have been so prepared subject to 
matters that are not material for determining (by reference to the items mentioned in 
section 763(1)) whether the distribution would contravene this Part. 

(4) “Properly prepared” means prepared in accordance with section 387 (requirements for 
company individual accounts), applying those requirements with such modifications as 
are necessary because the accounts are prepared otherwise than in respect of an 
accounting reference period. 

(5) The balance sheet comprised in the accounts must have been signed in accordance with 
section 401. 

(6) A copy of the accounts must have been delivered to the Registrar. 

Any requirement of these Regulations as to the delivery of a certified translation into 
English of any document forming part of the accounts must also have been met. 

766. Requirements where initial accounts used 

(1) Initial accounts must be accounts that enable a reasonable judgment to be made as to 
the amounts of the items mentioned in section 763(1). 

(2) Where initial accounts are prepared for a proposed distribution by a public company, 
the following requirements apply. 

(3) The accounts must have been properly prepared, or have been so prepared subject to 
matters that are not material for determining (by reference to the items mentioned in 
section 763(1)) whether the distribution would contravene this Part. 

(4) “Properly prepared” means prepared in accordance with section 387 (requirements for 
company individual accounts), applying those requirements with such modifications as 
are necessary because the accounts are prepared otherwise than in respect of an 
accounting reference period. 

411 
 



    

(5) The company's auditor must have made a report stating whether, in his opinion, the 
accounts have been properly prepared. 

(6) If that report was qualified- 

(a) the auditor must have stated in writing (either at the time of his report or 
subsequently) whether in his opinion the matters in respect of which his report 
is qualified are material for determining whether a distribution would 
contravene this Part, and 

(b) a copy of that statement must have been laid before the company in general 
meeting. 

(7) A copy of the accounts, of the auditor's report and of any auditor's statement must have 
been delivered to the Registrar. 

Any requirement of these Regulations as to the delivery of a certified translation into 
English of any of those documents must also have been met. 

767. Successive distributions etc by reference to the same accounts 

(1) In determining whether a proposed distribution may be made by a company in a case 
where- 

(a) one or more previous distributions have been made in pursuance of a 
determination made by reference to the same relevant accounts, or 

(b) relevant financial assistance has been given, or other relevant payments have 
been made, since those accounts were prepared, 

the provisions of this Part apply as if the amount of the proposed distribution was 
increased by the amount of the previous distributions, financial assistance and other 
payments. 

(2) The financial assistance and other payments that are relevant for this purpose are- 

(a) financial assistance lawfully given by the company out of its distributable 
profits, 

(b) financial assistance given by the company in contravention of section 617 or 
618 (prohibited financial assistance) in a case where the giving of that assistance 
reduces the company's net assets or increases its net liabilities, 

(c) payments made by the company in respect of the purchase by it of shares in the 
company, except a payment lawfully made otherwise than out of distributable 
profits, 

(d) payments of any description specified in section 645 (payments apart from 
purchase price of shares to be made out of distributable profits). 

(3) In this section “financial assistance” has the same meaning as in Chapter 2 of Part 17  
(see section 616). 

(4) For the purpose of applying subsection (2)(b) in relation to any financial assistance- 

(a) “net assets” means the amount by which the aggregate amount of the company's 
assets exceeds the aggregate amount of its liabilities, and 

412 
 



    

(b) “net liabilities” means the amount by which the aggregate amount of the 
company's liabilities exceeds the aggregate amount of its assets, 

taking the amount of the assets and liabilities to be as stated in the company's 
accounting records immediately before the financial assistance is given. 

(5) For this purpose a company's liabilities include any amount retained as reasonably 
necessary for the purposes of providing for any liability- 

(a) the nature of which is clearly defined, and 

(b) which is either likely to be incurred or certain to be incurred but uncertain as to 
amount or as to the date on which it will arise. 

CHAPTER 3  

SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS 

Arrangement of provisions 

768. Realised losses and profits and revaluation of fixed assets 

(1) The following provisions have effect for the purposes of this Part. 

(2) Realised losses include provisions of any kind (except revaluation provisions). 

(3) A “revaluation provision” means a provision in respect of a diminution in value of a 
fixed asset appearing on a revaluation of all the fixed assets of the company, or of all 
of its fixed assets other than goodwill. 

(4) For the purpose of subsections (2) and (3) any consideration by the directors of the 
value at a particular time of a fixed asset is treated as a revaluation provided- 

(a) the directors are satisfied that the aggregate value at that time of the fixed assets 
of the company that have not actually been revalued is not less than the 
aggregate amount at which they are then stated in the company's accounts, and 

(b) it is stated in a note to the accounts- 

(i) that the directors have considered the value of some or all of the fixed 
assets of the company without actually revaluing them, 

(ii) that they are satisfied that the aggregate value of those assets at the time 
of their consideration was not less than the aggregate amount at which 
they were then stated in the company's accounts, and 

(iii) that accordingly, by virtue of this subsection, amounts are stated in the 
accounts on the basis that a revaluation of fixed assets of the company is 
treated as having taken place at that time. 

(5) Where- 

(a) on the revaluation of a fixed asset, an unrealised profit is shown to have been 
made, and 

413 
 



    

(b) on or after the revaluation, a sum is written off or retained for depreciation of 
that asset over a period, 

an amount equal to the amount by which that sum exceeds the sum which would have 
been so written off or retained for the depreciation of that asset over that period, if 
that profit had not been made, is treated as a realised profit made over that period. 

769. Determination of profit or loss in respect of asset where records incomplete 

In determining for the purposes of this Part whether a company has made a profit or 
loss in respect of an asset where- 

(a) there is no record of the original cost of the asset, or 

(b) a record cannot be obtained without unreasonable expense or delay, 

its cost is taken to be the value ascribed to it in the earliest available record of its value 
made on or after its acquisition by the company.  

770. Treatment of development costs 

(1) Where development costs are shown or included as an asset in a company's accounts, 
any amount shown or included in respect of those costs is treated for the purposes of 
section 761 (distributions to be made only out of profits available for the purpose) as a 
realised loss. 

This is subject to the following exceptions.  

(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to any part of that amount representing an unrealised 
profit made on revaluation of those costs. 

(3) Subsection (1) does not apply if- 

(a) there are special circumstances in the company's case justifying the directors in 
deciding that the amount there mentioned is not to be treated as required by 
subsection (1), 

(b) it is stated in any note to the accounts, that the amount is not to be so treated, 
and
